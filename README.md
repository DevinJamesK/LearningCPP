# LearningCPP
A collection of simple C++ programs for teaching and learning.

## Getting Started ##
For learning C++, the simplest way is to use a basic text editor and a console that can run the command g++.

When you are first learning to program there is no need yet for a large complex application called an intergraded 
development envirement or IDE for short. These IDEs can be very helpful later but for now lets keep it simple and 
download a simpler yet still powerful text editor called Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/

Visual Studio Code should not be confusted with the full Visual Studie IDE.  Visual Studio Code is the same text 
editor that full Visual Studio uses but without many of its other features to help cut down on the complexity. 
Many professional developers elect to work this way forever and never use a full IDE but if you wanted to upgrade 
to the full Visual Studio IDE later it will look very familiar after using Visual Studio Code.  It is also cross
platform so you only have to learn one program to write code on any operating system.
